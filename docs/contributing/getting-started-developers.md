# Getting started with the generator Codebase

If you are authoring templates for Web Template Studio, or interested in contributing to this repo, then you are likely interested in how to use the latest version of this code.

This document covers:
- Prerequisites
- Project folder structure
- Core Template Studio Submodule
- How to run the extension locally
- How to develop the client
- How to built a local vsix

Before starting make sure you read the [Web Template Studio arquitecture](application-architecture.md) document.

If you just want to take advantage from Web Template Studio extension, check the [Web Template Studio Installation Instructions page](../install.md).

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
4. Install [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
5. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
6. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). You will need to finish installing Node.js before you install Yarn.
7. Run the command `npm config set scripts-prepend-node-path true`. This tells VSCode which Node version to run during the extension compilation (otherwise you'll get an error during the build process).

_Note: If using Windows, use Git Bash_.

## Project folder structure

### src folder
This folder contains the source code for the different components of Web Template Studio.

- client: This folder contains the client or wizard code.

[TODO] Client folder structure from https://github.com/microsoft/WebTemplateStudio/wiki/Developing-the-Frontend#folder-structure

- extension: This folder contains the Visual Studio extensions code.

[TODO] Extension folder structure

- CoreTemplateStudio: This solution contains the Core Template Studio code.

[TODO] Link to CoreTS


### _build folder
This folder contains scripts for local development and usage from the build pipeline.

### templates folder
This folder contains the templates that are used to generate the code. For more info on templates see 
[Understanding the Templates](templates.md).

## Core Template Studio Submodule
Web Template Studio relies on Core Template Studio for template synchronization and template composition, generation and postaction. Core Template Studio has its own Github repository github.com/Microsoft/CoreTemplateStudio as it is shared with the sister project Windows Template Studio github.com/Microsoft/WindowsTemplateStudio.

Core Template Studio is integrated into Web Template Studio using a git submodule under the folder (../src/CoreTemplateStudio). The submodule points to a specific commit in Core Template Studio, that you can see in github:

![Core Template Studio Submodule](../resources/corets-submodule.png)

### Init /update
When you clone Web Template Studio you have to run two commands: `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch all the data from Core Template Studio. When fetching changes, also execute `git submodule update` after doing git fetch to be sure you're submodule is up to date.

### Update with remote changes
Changes on Core Template Studio should be done on the Core Template Studio repos. In WebTS, to update the submodule to the most recent commit, you have to run the command: `git submodule update --remote`.

## Run the extension locally
1. Run `./build-all.sh` from the _build folder. This script installs dependencies and compiles the client and core template studio and copies it to the extension. It also builds and installs the extension. There are also separate scripts for building the client (build-client.sh), the Core Template Studio Cli (build-coretscli.sh), or the extension (build-extension.sh) available.
2. Open the `src/extension` folder using `VSCode`.
3. Start the debugger by pressing `F5`. This should open the Extension Development Host in a new Visual Studio Code window.
4. In the Extension Development Host, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows/Linux or `Command âŒ˜ + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette.
5. In the Command Palette, type `Web Template Studio: Launch` and press `Enter` to launch the extension. Make sure that you don't have the Web Template Studio from the marketplace installed, concurrent installation is nor yet supported.

## Developing the client
As the client is embedded as a static web app in the extension, debugging inside the extension can be challenging. Running the client in a browser is useful for quickly testing HTML or CSS changes, and for debugging since you can use Chrome extensions such as React and Redux developer tools. 

When running in the browser [TODO]

Note that the behavior of on the browser may differ from the behavior in the extension so make sure to test out both.

1. Run `./build-client.sh` from the _build folder.
2. Open the `src/client` folder using `VSCode`.
3. Start the client using `yarn start` to begin development in the browser. We recommend using a chromium based browser such as Chrome.

### To debug from Visual Studio Code:
Install [Debugger for Chrome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) in Visual Studio Code debug Wizard Client.
After starting the client using `yarn start` in VSCode Debug View (Ctrl+Shift+D) select "Debug WebTS Client" and start debugging (F5)
