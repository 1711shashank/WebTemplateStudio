# Generated Templates

This folder is for the development of the final boiler plate code that will be generated by web template studio. In the future this code will be converted to into templates that the engine can use.

## Developing Templates

Templates are being developed using the create-react-app starter kit. To run for development enter a specific folder and run:

```
npm start
```

The web app will then be available at localhost:3000.

## Templates Contained
